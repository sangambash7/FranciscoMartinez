                My aim as a teacher is to act as an enabler for students to
                become active inquirers of social processes and of the
                materialisation of contemporary transformations through
                ethnographic methods. Accordingly, one of my primary goals in
                teaching is to develop the analytical thinking and research
                skills of the students. As an educator, I try to help students
                to build evidence-based arguments and to consider viewpoints
                other than their own, and then communicate these ideas
                effectively. I encourage students to share their own experiences
                and learn from one another, cultivating observation and
                accessing perspectives beyond their own. Rather than simply
                handing down knowledge in a one-way channel, I facilitate
                multiple learning processes, encouraging students to be aware of
                contemporary issues. Also I strive to provide tools of analysis
                that students can employ outside of the classroom.

                My classes tend to be horizontal, favouring dialogue and
                multi-modal participation. In my teaching, I connect class
                discussions with the world outside academia and the own living
                experience of students, trying to motivate them for engaging in
                independent work and for reconsidering the prevailing notions of
                relevance. Usually, my course starts by providing the students
                with a general framework of theoretical and research tools
                during the first meetings, challenging their understanding of
                the subject with specific problems, and increasingly
                transferring our focus from lectures to more of dialogue and
                collaborative tasks, which end with intensive independent work
                for a practical project.

                As I teach, I continue to actively learn how to be a better
                lecturer and supervisor to my students. They also have different
                learning styles, and I seek to accommodate these various ways of
                learning by adapting the pedagogical tools during the process. I
                have experienced that new knowledge is built on previously
                acquired knowledge; thus, a lecturer has to adapt the
                pedagogical material to the experience of the audience and
                constantly exemplify knowledge. Also, the lecturer should be in
                charge of providing a context for thinking and to lead
                discussions about the issues raised, helping to formulate the
                problems, to choose the theoretical framework and methodology,
                to considering alternative perspectives and to push both the
                analytical and writing processes forward.

                Teaching in higher education means being in contact with young,
                inspiring yet often challenging people. During the last thirteen
                years, I have acquired a considerable experience in teaching and
                supervision, being always open to collect feedback and use it in
                different ways to develop my teaching. For instance, I have
                found that hands-on exercises with objects or documents are
                effective in stimulating students to think creatively and
                examine information within various frames of reference. This is
                complemented with practical field exercises that allow the
                student to train what they have learnt and to feel the
                excitement of discovery. Likewise, the possibility of presenting
                the findings publicly (in the form of a workshop, a booklet, an
                exhibition), encouraged students to work independently in some
                of the courses I have taught (Material Culture, Ethnographic
                methods, Social Design…)

                Lecturing in different countries and coordinating pedagogical
                activities in different institutions gave me the muscle needed
                to provide top-level research-based teaching as well as to
                supervise and review theses. For instance, I learnt that there
                are many aspects in supervision that do not directly have to do
                with the object of study or the research task at hand. Also that
                there are other correlated challenges, such as creating a
                supportive environment and strengthening self-confidence for
                making the students apt to disclose their doubts and
                expectations.

                In 2019, I co-directed the MA programme in Art Museums and
                Gallery Studies at the University of Leicester, where one of my
                students defended her PhD. In 2022, I created the new MA
                programme in Social Design at the Estonian Academy of Arts,
                developing a curriculum at the intersection of design
                anthropology and design philosophy. Overall, I have taught a
                total of 21 different courses in various universities. Also, I
                have given dozens of public lectures and three keynotes.

                  Materiality is no longer the sole concern of museum scholars
                  and archaeologists, but a tangential focus of analysis for
                  anyone interested in how objects establish social meanings on
                  behalf of people. This course locates itself in the interface
                  of various material culture-oriented disciplines, namely
                  anthropology, art history, museum studies and archaeology. It
                  focuses on the social and cultural implications of material
                  experiences, examining people’s engagement with things, the
                  affective aspects of this interactions, the significance of
                  things in different contexts, the practices, relations, and
                  rituals through which things become meaningful, as well as how
                  things say about their owners and about social relationships.
                  In this course, we will also discuss other related topics such
                  as consumption, memory, valuation, obsolescence, clothing,
                  aesthetics and digital technologies. Among our reading list,
                  we will have both theoretical surveys as well as
                  context-sensitive and nuanced accounts. Students will gain a
                  conceptual understanding, methodological tools and theoretical
                  knowledge on this field of studies. The independent work will
                  be organised in the form of mini-ethnographies, offering
                  insights into social relations and cultural representations
                  through objects.

                  This course places anthropology and design at the centre of
                  social and ecological issues and develops epistemic tools for
                  dealing with contemporary challenges. It reverses the
                  traditional approach by taking design as an epistemic
                  activity, and anthropology as a material one. The course aims
                  at expanding the interventive capacity of anthropology in
                  societal issues, and how we can reconfigure political problems
                  and their relevance. It starts by assuming that there is a
                  need of equipping the rich middle ground in between
                  ethnographic research and design practice, reflecting on the
                  kind of spaces where different activities can mingle. By this
                  gesture, social scientists have an opportunity to embrace new
                  roles and validate emergent practices that have much to do
                  with this look towards design. Hence, one of the key
                  challenges that we will face is how to connect different
                  communities of practice and traditions, while mutually
                  improving our knowledge-making capacities.
                </p>

                <p>
                  This course will also enable a learning of ethnographic
                  methods with and through design practices, exploring novel
                  forms of doing social research together. Overall, we will
                  learn about the productive grounds for conversations between a
                  more designerly ethnography and ethnographic design practices,
                  while accounting of the capacity of anthropology to experiment
                  and advancing on how to reconfigure social problems and their
                  relevance. The course contains theory, ethnographic insights,
                  a guest lecture and a field trip. The independent work will be
                  organised in the form of mini-ethnographies, offering insights
                  into social relations, personal affections and cultural
                  representations through physical things. Practitioners
                  insights and mini-ethnographies will be complemented with
                  group discussions as well as an interdisciplinary review of
                  the relevant body of literature and in relation to our
                  selected case studies or themes.

                  What is gained from studying repair practices? What does it
                  mean to claim that something is broken? And who measures the
                  value of fixing up things? This course engages with
                  contemporary discussions on the re-politicisation of the
                  material by situating care and sustainability at the centre of
                  politics. Repair has a stronger epistemic dimension than
                  regeneration and resilience. It is intimately integrated
                  within the existing ecologies of knowledge, and is both
                  socially embedded and culturally informed, finding nuances
                  rooted within local history, material culture and power
                  relations. This course offers conceptual and methodological
                  training for students to examine how relationships are
                  sustained in relation to the maintenance of built forms,
                  opening up a wide range of questions about responsibility,
                  care-taking, and sustainability.

                  Our primary focus is about people doing things, handling
                  situations: holding on, letting go; but we will also pay
                  attention to the ordering strategies of institutions through
                  repair and maintenance. Using a wide range of methodologies,
                  field techniques, and theoretical approaches we will examine
                  cross-cultural materialities of care and the repair done
                  around us. The fieldwork observation will be complemented with
                  group discussions as well as an interdisciplinary review of
                  the relevant body of literature related to repair and
                  organised in relation to our selected themes, learning to
                  understand that repair is more than a technique.

                  This course sets up to give the student a working familiarity
                  with qualitative research methods and academic writing. It
                  provides advanced introductions to a representative range of
                  field techniques, including ethnography, participant
                  observation, interviews, case studies, surveys, oral history,
                  archival research, artistic experiments, soundscaping and
                  literary descriptions. Students will hone their skills in
                  applying theoretical knowledge to practical research, becoming
                  a generator of reliable and useful information about the world
                  and raising awareness and contributing to the understanding of
                  actual social dynamics. Students will gain a knowledge of
                  issues central to the conduct of qualitative research, such as
                  validity and reliability, the political and ethical
                  implications of social research, and the applicability of
                  particular qualitative methods for particular research
                  approaches and acquisition of funding.

                  design a meaningful and original research project and
                  undertake the necessary work for collecting data. We will read
                  contemporary works (accessing to inspiring examples and
                  methodologies). The fieldwork observation will be complemented
                  with group discussions as well as an interdisciplinary review
                  of the relevant body of literature related to our selected
                  theme or case studies. The independent work of the students
                  will be organised around their own research interest. The
                  course will also provide practical, hands-on experience in
                  using selected methods. For their assignment, students will
                  write a detailed proposal for a future research project based
                  on preliminary research performed during the course.
