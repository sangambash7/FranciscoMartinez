            Changing margins and relations within European anthropology.

          <p>
            This instalment problematises the disciplinary boundaries of
            European anthropology by studying the shifting conditions of our
            work and changing centres of gravity in the field. We reconsidered
            what the concept of “European anthropology” brings actually to the
            fore, while working in a context of changing epistemic relations,
            labour conditions, institutional assessment, claims to disciplinary
            validity, and the relation between localities and practitioners. We
            argue that European anthropology does not exist as a single, easy to
            define entity precisely because it exceeds its conditions of
            possibility and goes beyond geographic relations and separations. We
            conclude that a key feature characterising European anthropology is
            its transnational character – troubling of the boundaries of the
            discipline and the geographical continent.
