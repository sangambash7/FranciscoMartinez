            This article asks how a post-Soviet city went global and became
            something else, mutating, in the sense of generating a new set of
            features that go beyond a narrow understanding of postsocialism. The
            research provides a synthetic conceptualisation of Narva and the
            organisation of its ordinary life, by combining methods of urban
            observation and classification with geographical and ethnographic
            descriptions of this city. Using visual imagery of urban objects,
            along with field annotations and interview quotes as the materials
            analysed, the article carries out a Narvaology that consists in
            deploying this city ‘as method’. It points out that cities such as
            Narva require a more relational and multi-scalar language, one with
            broader theoretical and methodological implications, able to account
            for fragmentary socio-political issues.
