            This book explores whether the metaphors of ‘playground’ and
            ‘battlefield’ might be analytically meaningful terms for
            understanding contemporary society. This conceptualisation is
            employed as an allegory to connect processes of social
            transformation and the making of risky choices with practices of
            politically uneven power distributions. The dialectic relationship
            between joy and struggle becomes the heart of the spatial analysis
            of different sociocultural practices. The duality is presented as a
            space of becoming, related to the recreation, domination and
            experience of a place, as well as to corresponding practices of
            excess, interaction and enjoyment.

            This book takes a look at the contemporary urban capitalist society
            in its restlessness, instabilities and precarious life-forms. The
            authors go out of their disciplinary boundaries to find explanation
            for complex phenomena, combining in a fresh and clever way diverse
            professional fields. In several cases it prefers a sideways look
            rather than a confrontational one; a strategy that turns out to be
            rather constructive. We could categorise this book under the label
            of critical spatial theory: critical, in that it aims toward not
            only an explanation but also real change; spatial in that it sees
            contemporary processes carefully embedded in the midst of
            crisscrossing trajectories, local simultaneities and human
            becomings.

            This book allows the reader to access to topographies of change. The
            image of the playground is very accurate and related to multiple
            typologies of resistance in the actual crisis. It’s not only
            Occupy-movements in the entire world, but the way in which societies
            deal with their pasts—and their futures. This is the other side of
            the book: battlefields. Here the authors not only try to explain
            what their view of a playground is but they are proposing how to use
            this concept for accessing the rituality of everyday life in a
            post-shock global society as ours.

            Playgrounds and Battlefields is an eclectic yet vibrant book, with a
            free-wheeling and anarchical approach that, if occasionally jarring,
            delivers on its transdisciplinary goals. The committed reader of the
            book will not only encounter a wide range of discussions with value
            in their own right, but by remaining open to their interactions
            staged within the volume, will gain fresh perspectives upon future
            possibilities within the humanities as well as avenues by which they
            may re-engage with the social and political demands of our time.
