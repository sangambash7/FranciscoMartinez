          <p>
            Certain stories of failure can shadow us wherever we go,
            reverberating and giving form to our professional identity as
            anthropologists. Field accidents decentre us from our original plan
            and from our object of study, generating dynamics of disorder and
            epistemic detours. In this chapter, I engage with a set of field
            accidents and unresolved questions in my research experience in
            Georgia. Normative approaches would argue that learning from
            something unlearnt is not possible and simply dismiss that these
            encounters lacked ethnographicness. Yet, the experience shows that
            fieldwork is not necessarily guided by an understanding of what
            significance or relevance are, nor does it have to follow
            well-planned techniques that involve systematic methods for
            assembling data. The awareness of our limited knowledge makes
            possible an excess of ideas and of relations, and lead us to
            questions that were not previously mapped.
