            The interest in more mindful consumerist practices has been
            increasing over the last few years, fact that is evidenced by a
            growing number of publications, podcasts, and social media groups on
            the topic. I have investigated how having fewer things provides the
            opportunity to engage more intensely with them and deepen
            relationship with the items we chose to keep. Nevertheless,
            alternative forms of consumption do not follow a coherent pattern,
            since people might downshift in one domain and consume conspicuously
            in another domain. Therefore, actual ways of pondering the line
            between essential products for life and those that are not deserve a
            nuanced ethnographic understanding.
