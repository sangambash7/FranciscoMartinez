            was an exhibition and a book-catalogue. It set out to reflect on the
            art and materiality of everyday survival in Tbilisi, outlining local
            notions of breakage, care and craftsmanship. At the level of the
            quotidian we found paradoxical expressions of material culture and a
            particular distress arising from the gap between the human desire to
            improve the actual situation and the suffering caused by not being
            able to do so. In this light, we explored micro-works of adaptation
            and a sense of distributed creativity — namely, the way that people
            make use of what is around them in order to cope with abrupt social
            changes. Also, we drew on such terms as scrappiness to describe
            those arrangements that constitute finality without being finished;
            khaltura, which expresses low-key engagements; and euroremont, a
            fixing practice that emerged subsequent to the desire to achieve a
            particular social status by following what seemed to be Western
            standards.

            Aesthetics of Repair is a multi-layered concept that, on the one
            hand, conceptualizes the societal condition of transition where old
            values are no longer valid or desired even though new ones don’t yet
            exist or seem to exist somewhere else. On the other hand, it
            conceptualizes the newly found appreciation of old values and local
            histories, and the beauty that lies in repairing rather than
            replacing them: giving up one’s feelings of shame over the local and
            the old, and combining them with the worldly and the new. The fact
            that the exhibition title consists of two somewhat contradictory
            terms, aesthetics and repair is by no means arbitrary in this
            context. Here, the postcolonial is at work, but less as an adopted
            theory than as a developed mindset: becoming historically self-aware
            and culturally generative after a traumatic historical experience or
            continuing economic hardship. Considering how little resistance
            there has been in Eastern Europe to Western theory, such an attempt
            to create original terms and concepts from local contexts, and to
            reflect on the unique historical conditions of these countries, is
            both needed and welcome.
