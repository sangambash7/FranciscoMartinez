            This article proposes an artistic performance to reflect on the
            labour of fieldwork and our economy of attention. The experimental
            method consists in installing myself at a caf√© in Lisbon and Tbilisi
            for 35 hours beyond the reach of smartphones and laptops and then
            doing nothing. Across this exercise, time slows, opening a clearer
            window into ordinary life. The intervention raises questions about
            the way digital technologies transform the temporality and
            experience of ethnographic fieldwork. The essay sets up to make a
            methodological contribution to a growing literature about
            experimental methods, reminding us that observation is a tiring
            physical experience and that slow time is correlated with
            anthropological quality. Doing nothing appears as a slow time being
            in front of others, which enables a break of consciousness, suspends
            politics of relevance, and leaves space for serendipity and embodied
            imagination.
