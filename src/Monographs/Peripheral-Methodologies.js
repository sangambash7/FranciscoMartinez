            How does peripherality challenge our research and what we can know?
            This volume shows that peripherality is not only to be seen as a
            marginal condition, but rather as a form of theory-making and
            practice that incorporates reflexivity and experimentation. The
            research investigates that which cannot be easily captured and
            framed into normative boundaries. Thus, instead of domesticating the
            peripheral, the authors engage in (and insist on) unlearning their
            tools in order to integrate the empirical and analytical otherwise.
            The book, therefore, examines how the peripheral can be incorporated
            into ethnographic research, and reflects on what it means to be on
            the periphery—ontologically and epistemologically.

            In a time when positivist pretensions seek to present qualitative
            work as predictable and controllable, the great asset of this
            stimulating volume is how it embraces the unknown. Ethnographers
            almost naturally enter their field peripherally. Always coming from
            elsewhere, strangers in language and everyday habits, their
            strengths reside in their potential to keenly observe and, in
            painstakingly learning, to lay open what is but tacitly present: the
            multitude of practices that are at the heart of the human condition.

            Through sometimes tricky and often tense ethnographic chapters, the
            book helps to deepen and enliven debate on how to decenter customary
            epistemological, methodological and institutional practices, habits
            that have run their course, yet continue to resist unlearning. In
            these messy times, such efforts to cultivate attention are more
            necessary than ever, and I applaud the book’s ambition to pursue
            just that.

            It is really a book, not just a collection of studies pushed under
            an umbrella term. It tells a story, looking at friendship, home,
            childcare, craft-making, revelations and cooperations to delivers
            soft, nuanced, clever, self-reflective, eye-opening analysis. A good
            book for better times? Maybe. A good book for a better anthropology?
            Definitely.

            The main novelty of the book is to approach the concept of periphery
            as a methodological issue…. It aims to open a conversation about the
            need to generate different ways of being attentive to the reality,
            transcending conventional divides and pushing methods beyond their
            traditional disciplinary constraints. The path toward this objective
            is filled with provocative insights and arguments that make this
            book a significant contribution to anthropology.
