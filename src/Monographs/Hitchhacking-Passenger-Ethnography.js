            In this essay, we propose hitchhacking as a way of problematizing
            contemporary mobility and as a practice of what we call ‘passenger
            ethnography’. To this end, we review some of the literature on
            hitchhiking and offer empirical examples from Estonia, Russia and
            Finland. We also reflect on how autostop can be experienced as a
            means of knowledge production. Accordingly, we discuss how
            travelling together by car provides a particular type of
            socialisation, one in which side observation, liminality and risk
            condition the possibility of field research. Finally, we refer to
            hitchhiking as a form of gift-giving in which no reciprocation is
            required. The key contributions are thus threefold: i) to rethink
            the transgressive and heuristic potential of hitchhiking in the
            present; ii) to reflect on the methodological implications of doing
            ethnographic research on/in vehicles; and iii) to problematize
            commuting in a context of extensive digital technology usage and
            market-type notions of productivity.
