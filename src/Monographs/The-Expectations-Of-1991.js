            Post-socialism is now twenty-five years old, an appropriate
            milestone to reflect on this social phenomenon and the
            multidimensional processes that were set in motion by the break-up
            of the Soviet Union. It is time then to ask about the lessons of the
            post-Soviet period; to examine the triumphalist rhetoric of the
            early 1990s; to attest how those expectations were articulated,
            conveyed and reconstructed. Indeed, is the 1989–1991 frame of
            understanding still relevant? With this series of articles and a
            comment, we set out to explore the ways in which European societies,
            and Europe itself, differ from what had been hoped and designed in
            the years 1989–1991. The contributions put the emphasis on the
            different horizons of expectation and realms of experience that have
            their roots in 1989–1991, exploring whether this period continues to
            define individuals, societies and historical representations of
            Eastern Europe and beyond.
