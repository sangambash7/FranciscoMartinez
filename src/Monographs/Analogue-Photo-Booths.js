            Why do analogue photos still fascinate young people? Why, for some
            purposes, might vintage technologies be considered more authentic
            than newer ones? And what is the contribution of old-school photo
            booths to Berlin as a city? Based on participant observation and 60
            interviews with users, the research shows how the relationship
            between these old-school booths and Berlin is reciprocal, becoming
            part of the cityâ€™s scene, assembling people, displaying and
            materialising relationships, thereby providing an opportunity to be
            private in public. In casting an ethnographic eye on analogue photo
            booths in Berlin, this article makes a case for the continued
            relevance of analogue technologies and practices in the
            con-temporary digital age. The research highlights the
            inconsistencies in the linear theories of media development and
            social change, therefore pointing to a complex co-existence of
            actual and emerging technologies and practices.
