            What to preserve and how to do so are key challenges of the present.
            As heritage is past socially made durable, contingent elements of
            the present have to be cut off. Then, they are presented as
            something that has to be sacrificed for clarity and fixity. The
            question is how, and by whom, and the answer has to be found in
            situated, empirical cases. For instance, there is a building in
            Sillamäe that has been listed as heritage for twenty-three years;
            however, the resources to fix its forms and reduce its material
            instability have not been found and mobilized since. In this
            chapter, I examine a case of postindustrial ambivalent heritage that
            is not a factory, but a cinema built for its workers. Industrial
            activity, closely connected with modern infrastructural ideas, often
            came along with venues such as cinemas, theatres, sport halls,
            military bases, hospitals, schools and media offices. Thus,
            industrial heritage can also be found in sites that are related to
            factories only indirectly, such as electrical grids, roads and
            ports, but also schools, hospitals and leisure facilities, such as
            cinemas. Also, we can define ambivalent heritage as everything that
            failed to go away and remains against the grain, creating discomfort
            in those around. Indeed, a sense of annoyance, and even
            embarrassment, is associated with Kino Rodina, one that is not
            necessarily related to the original function of the building, or how
            it was constructed (mostly by war prisoners), but because of its
            condition of decay.
