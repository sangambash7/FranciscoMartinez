          <p>
            This entry to the Anti-Atlas sketches the outlines of a
            transnational continent of the (semi-) fringes. Less Moscow or
            London, more Leicester, Tampere and Tallinn, as his own career
            evidences. The much-attested disadvantages of peripheral status,
            including the centres’ refusal to see such locales on their own
            terms, are here compensated by the advantages (ambiguity and
            distance) of relative remoteness – though peripherality can be as
            much a political condition as a state of mind and a geography of
            displacement.
