            Memory, don’t speak! Monumental neglect and memorial sacrifice in

            This article discusses how monuments exist in time, conceptualising
            memory politics in relation to monumental neglect and lack of
            maintenance work. It foregrounds the ages of memory by studying how
            forgetting is inscribed on Soviet cultural heritage and engendered
            through crumbling materiality in Estonia – as a slow-motion
            sacrifice.

            The research focuses on the Maarjamäe memorial complex in Tallinn,
            which is composed of a Soviet monumental landscape design, a
            cemetery of German soldiers, a Russian palace currently hosting the
            Estonian History Museum, and the newly built memorial of Victims of
            Communism. It shows how the landscape memorial has been devalued by
            the political work of disrepair and institutional neglect,
            presenting the socialist past as something separated from the
            present. New developments in this site will potentially change its
            situation of abandonment, since the construction of a novel
            antagonist element, the memorial of Victims of Communism, might
            produce a more attentive maintenance of the Soviet monumental design
            (adding another layer of meaning), or its final demolition in turn
            (producing a haunting afterlife).
