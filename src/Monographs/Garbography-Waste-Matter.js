            This article reconsiders how the organic, the symbolic, and matter
            are entangled by examining the relation between ethnographic
            accounts and non-human inscriptions. It aims at developing a way of
            engaging with the dynamism of residual matter at the conceptual
            level to expanding the range of possibilities of research on waste.
            What we call garbography places the focus on the mattering of waste
            as a mode of inquiry, assuming that we can portray how waste
            expresses itself to our senses. However, the gesture of going beyond
            the anthropocentric bias unsettles the predominant meaning-centric
            understanding of fieldwork. To practice garbography entails paying
            attention to the expressiveness of residual matter as an asemic
            inscription or graphein of sorts. It is thus to be involved in
            different exercises of tracing and speaking for material signs that
            might not be directly translatable to verbal language, yet allow us
            to venture into strange, stinky realms.
