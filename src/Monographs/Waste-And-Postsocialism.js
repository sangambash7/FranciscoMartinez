            This article explores notions of postsocialism, Europe and waste in
            relation to each other to understand the changing scripts and
            standards in Estonia. The research offers important information
            about the ways in which waste practices have changed (or not) in
            accordance to EU regulations and standards, and provides significant
            data to highlight the emergence of controversies and negotiations
            around this issue across different scales. After examining waste
            politics in Estonia, the article concludes that for this country,
            postsocialist transformations implied a break in orders of
            knowledge, as part of an intensive social negotiation within the
            framework of the EU. Nonetheless, it also foregrounds that waste
            practices show relevant continuities and complex scale effects in
            the new chain of connections and legislation.
