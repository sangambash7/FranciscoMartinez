            What would an exhibition that asks ethnographic questions rather
            than presenting fixed categories look like? This book describes how
            to organize exhibitions as ethnographic devices: not only as
            attempts to communicate research results, but as techniques for
            inventing, re-designing and critically questioning a social reality.
            This way of investigating contributes to distribute the analytical
            capacity among the different actors involved in the exhibition, as
            well as making the public participants in our re-presentations of
            reality.

            The book opens up a vast field of methodological explorations,
            providing a repertoire to reconsider ethnography and objecthood
            while producing knowledge with people of different backgrounds. It
            invites the reader to reflect on the skills of collaboration and
            experimentation in fieldwork and in gallery curation, thereby
            expanding the possibilities for transdisciplinary collaborations,
            the opportunity to use exhibitions as research devices, and the role
            of experimentation in the exhibition process.

            With great verve, this wonderfully enjoyable book takes a fresh,
            insightful look at creative collaborations between anthropologists,
            artists and designers. It explores how these kinds of partnerships
            take shape and dynamically generate new knowledge. The book includes
            an important and fascinating examination of the potential of the
            exhibition as methodological device. It will be invaluable reading
            for anyone interested in museums, art, anthropology and their
            innovative intersections.

            Martínez has put together no less than a must-read treatise on
            ‘collaboratology’ where art spaces joyfully turn into a laboratory
            to experiment with the manifold contours anthropological practice
            might take. In the situations here recounted, epistemic generosity
            becomes a guiding research principle. One enabling anthropologists
            to relearn their craft from curators, inviting designers and artists
            to act as epistemic partners, and turning objects into springboards
            of stories and further relations. This book is a marvellous
            tour-de-force that will surely inspire readers to reconsider
            fieldwork as a ‘curated’ entity, unfolding in unexpected ways as
            part experimenting with a wide variety of devices.

            With Ethnographic Experiments, Martínez has curated scenarios for
            novel ethnographic relations. His approach to anthropology is
            capacious and creative, inviting future experiments for doing
            research differently. His writing easily moves across disciplinary
            boundaries, generously inviting readers into creative thought and
            sense processes. More than a meditation on boundary objects, his
            book is itself one. It transforms academia’s analytical intensities
            into thought-felt matters of concern.

            Kuraator Francisco Martineze üldisem põhieesmärk oli võtta maha
            pingeid kunstivälja ja ülejäänud kultuuri vahel – see ülesanne on
            eesti kultuuris endiselt oluline ja õnnestus eriti hästi eespool
            mainitud seminari ajal, kui maja oli uudistajaid/mõtestajaid täis.
