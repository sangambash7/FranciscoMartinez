            Exhibitions are usually understood in anthropology as representation
            techniques; however, they can also be used as a mode of inquiry.
            This piece outlines how to approach displays not simply as attempts
            to communicate research findings or existing social issues, but as a
            device to challenge, invent or critically question a reality â€“ being
            part of an ongoing reconfiguration of what knowledge and the
            political could be. By making use of exhibitions as experimental
            devices, we can display our concerns and make the ethnographic field
            happen in an inventive collaborative way. This mode of inquiry helps
            ethnographers to construct more distributed settings of knowledge
            production, operating as both an object of inquiry and a device
            available to different actors for acting-knowing. Hence, it can be
            practiced to open up a space between knowledge and invention, as
            well as new ways of being in the field.
