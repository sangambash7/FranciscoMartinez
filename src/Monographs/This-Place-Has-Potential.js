            "This Place Has Potential": Trash, Culture, and Urban Regeneration
            in Tallinn, Estonia.

            Suomen Antropologi, 2018

            The article analyses the use of cultural programmes and trash as
            tools for urban speculation in Tallinn, naturalising an urban
            strategy that entails an extensive real estate revaluation and
            socioeconomic intervention. Through an anthropological perspective
            focused on the use of the terms “potential” and “trash” in relation
            to the central-north shoreline, the analysis shows how these
            speculative narratives were mobilised to justify a capitalist
            development of the area. As a result, the area was framed as moving
            towards completion and as a playground for cultural activities in
            order to increase the real estate value and visibility of the
            shoreline, therefore allowing real estate developers to exploit the
            synergies generated and make profit from the revaluated plots. As
            the case study shows, when an area is classed as having ‘potential’,
            it becomes defined by the fulfilment of that restrictive
            conceptualisation, which allows the economy to dictate urban
            planning and also cultural policy.
