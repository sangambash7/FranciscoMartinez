            This article outlines narratives of trespass. It analyses relations
            between the personal and the social in abandoned urban physical
            surroundings. Grounded in our own duo-auto-ethnographic encounters
            with off-limit places, the research examines the classic notion of
            liminality through a set of prisms that are less than orthodox. It
            does so by stressing the formative and transformative possibilities
            of those threshold spaces that often get bypassed, surpassed or
            trespassed. Through a series of vignettes describing moments of
            urban exploration in different parts of Estonia, our implicit aim is
            to unsettle such conceptual categories as risk and adventure,
            material decay and transgression. Explicitly, we argue for
            revisiting storytelling tropes such as the fl√¢neur or the stalker,
            freeing them up from their respective leisure and pastime
            associations.
