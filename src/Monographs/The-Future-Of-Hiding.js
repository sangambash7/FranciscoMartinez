          <p>
            The Future of Hiding analyzes the territorial dimensions of secrecy,
            its contribution to social order, and how concealment takes place in
            relation to energy infrastructure. The ethnography shows how shadow
            spaces connect the private and the social by furnishing a space for
            retreat, thus allowing opacity and diversity against the central
            gaze. The research highlights the way in which basements, garages,
            bunkers, and summer cottages operate as a surplus of living at the
            border with Russia, allowing local residents to redesign the very
            terms of their social being.

            Field research in this liminal region provides a dearth of
            information about political alterity, ecological memory,
            recolonization, and what does not disappear properly. Therefore,
            this book expands the space for locating culture, politics, and the
            reproduction and destruction of infrastructure, showing, in turn,
            alternative forms of sociality and various strategies, such as
            refusal and concealment, used by individuals to navigate
            sociopolitical change and the consequences of a century of
            extractive activities.

            The Future of Hiding makes a significant contribution to our
            understanding of people, places, and things that are perceived as
            out of place and time, often relegated to a corner as disruptions to
            the social order. Drawing on ethnographic research in eastern
            Estonia, a region considered residual within the country’s context,
            Martínez demonstrates that the colonial character of extractivism is
            not that far past. These elements of infrastructural harm stem from
            present forms of domination that dictate modes of affiliation with
            the nation-state and foster a pervasive sense of precarity and
            uncertainty.

            This original book examines how infrastructures are lived in the
            borderlands between Russia and the European Union. The ethnography
            offers a thought-provoking examination of the gradual decomposition
            of a long-disappeared polity—the Soviet Union. Drawing on fieldwork
            in Estonia—an area often overlooked, Martínez transcends
            disciplinary boundaries to study topics ranging from post-socialism
            and colonialism to place-making, social organization, and identity
            formation. His work is not only meticulously researched but also
            deeply engaging.
