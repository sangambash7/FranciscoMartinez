          <p>
            The changes that our discipline has been undergoing over recent
            decades have accelerated, affecting the methodologies used, the
            themes being addressed and the labour conditions of practitioners.
            By re-opening the debate about anthropologyâ€™s sense of mission, this
            Forum containing 15 contributions also questions the very
            possibilities of critique inside the field of anthropology.
