            What forms of documentation emerge when preparing an exhibition? And
            what can an art document do to other things and professionals? This
            article studies curating as a way of producing documents. By looking
            back retrospectively to the array of documents produced during my
            art projects and reviewing theoretical approaches relevant to the
            development of archival documentation, I discuss how art documents
            can be constitutive of both knowledge and relations. Curation
            activities demand a proactive documentation and archiving since
            documents play a key role in consolidating the aesthetic value and
            relational potential of artworks. Art documents help to account of
            and multiply the knowledge that is mobilized during the making of an
            exhibition, but they also have performative efficacy as
            connectorsâ€”contributing to reach different audiences, to involve
            diverse participants, and to bring together dissimilar things.
