            The locking down and confining brought by the pandemic turned homes
            into both objects and places of research, and it drew attention to
            actual problems with homes. But the crisis is also inspiring
            reflections on what counts as research and evidence, and about what
            it might mean to do ethnography nowadays. In a series of
            instalments, we reflected on the multiple interrelations between
            anthropology and home, questioning what a home is and what it does
            methodologically through a series of multimodal micro-ethnographies.
            In a pandemic context, we felt impelled to invent new forms of
            collaboration and narration, designing methods that allow us to
            research from home and to reconsider the conditions and contexts
            where anthropology is produced.
