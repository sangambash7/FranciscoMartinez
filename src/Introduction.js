              Currently, I work at Tampere University within the ERC project
              WasteMatters. From September 2025, I will be a Ramón y Cajal
              Senior Research Fellow at the University of Murcia, Spain.

              Stemming from the international cooperation forged through my
              publications, grants, teaching and research experience, I have had
              the chance to regularly share my work in prestigious institutions
              across Europe, the UK, Russia and the Americas.

              In the field of European anthropology, I am known for my fresh and
              insightful contributions, which were recognized after being
              awarded the 2018 Early Career Prize by the European Association of
              Social Anthropologists. Other evidence of my professional
              achievements includes the appointments in diverse editorial
              boards, the convenorship of the EASA Network for Experimental
              Collaborations, and editing the Berghahn book series Politics of
              Repair (with P. Laviolette).

              My research has sought to explore different forms of material care
              and governance. For instance, my new monograph is The Future of
              Hiding, which will be published by Cornell University Press in
              2025, examines how a particular kind of sociality of secrecy is
              constituted in relation to extractive activities and as the side
              effect of infrastructural harm.

            Much of my research concerns how people relate to traces from the
            past as well as reconsiderations of what is deemed as unworthy of
            salvage. In Remains of the Soviet Past in Estonia, for instance, I
            studied memory politics in relation to the lack of maintenance work
            of the socialist legacies, which apparently had no place in the
            national present. Thus, the research investigated how the reparation
            of things, especially those that seem wasted, can be a way of
            shaping political subjectivities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Likewise, I have edited Politics of Recuperation in Post-crisis
            Portugal, a volume that discusses how the Portuguese society rebuilt
            itself after a painful economic crisis and imposed austerity
            measures; And Repair, Brokenness, Breakthrough (edited with P.
            Laviolette), which explains that the relevance of repair is not that
            happens, but rather the values attached to it, as well as the
            aesthetic, political, and moral implications that this gesture
            entails.

            By studying how we voluntarily reuse things and how these practices
            affect our relation with other people and the world, we can learn
            about the resignification of material imaginaries that were
            historically associated with poverty and are now acquiring a new
            symbol as related to sustainability and the awareness of planetary
            limits. But, once assuming that we have to give up some consumption,
            we firstly have to understand how and what kind of?
          </p>
          <p>
            In the theme issue ‘Living with and without Things’ (edited with T.
            Errázuriz), I have investigated how having fewer things provides the
            opportunity to engage more intensely with them and deepen
            relationship with the items we chose to keep. However, alternative
            forms of consumption do not follow a coherent pattern. Thus, actual
            ways of pondering the line between essential products and those that
            are not deserve a nuanced ethnographic understanding.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am particularly interested in how things unfold in time and space,
            and in the different material modes of knowing. That is why I edited
            the volume Peripheral Methodologies with L. Di Puppo and M.D.
            Frederiksen.
          </p>
          <p>
            My work has also carved a strongly independent and creative path,
            cultivating experimentality in ethnographic methods and material
            culture studies. An example of this is my curation of eleven
            exhibitions.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the exhibition Life in Decline (Estonian Mining Museum, 2021) I
            collaborated with a dozen of local artists and designers to
            represent ethnographically how infrastructure and people endure in a
            context of exhausted ecologies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, I have combined material culture with creative research in the
            project Greetings from Another Land and Another Time (with M. Agu at
            the Museum of Contemporary Art of Estonia, 2018). We gathered a
            series of postcards showing landscapes sacrificed by Soviet
            modernization in the twentieth century, and complemented them with
            practices of contemporary archaeology and archival research. The
            juxtaposition of different imaginaries of pollution allowed us to
            understand how embodied contamination are located in landscapes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another example of establishing a bridge between scholars and
            non-academic actors is Objects of Attention, organised at the
            Estonian Museum of Applied Art & Design. In this case, I invited ten
            international artists to revise an ordinary object into a political
            question. Based on this experience, I wrote Ethnographic Experiments
            with Artists, Designers and Boundary Objects (UCL Press, 2021). This
            book combines anthropology, art and design to exemplify how
            exhibitions can be used for doing social research.

            Our work is being affected by a greater range of materials,
            technologies, actors, temporalities, scales, and forms of
            value-allocation. Our societies, therefore, require more
            sophisticated research methods. In this vein, my work tends to
            address complex problems beyond disciplinary boundaries, paying
            close attention to the improvement of methodologies, while being
            committed to innovative and publicly relevant inquiries.
          </p>
          <p>
            Current changes in knowledge production impel us to combine
            different models of knowledge creation and dissemination and to
            include actors in new ways, encouraging reciprocity between academic
            and non-academic questioning. Nowadays, social relations are being
            affected by a greater range of materials, technologies, actors,
            scales, and forms of visibility. Our societies, therefore, require
            more sophisticated research methods.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this vein, my work tends to pay attention to the improvement of
            methodologies, while being committed to theoretically innovative and
            publicly relevant inquiries. For instance, the project Keeping
            Things in the Dark was developed through three exhibitions: in the
            Riga Art Space (2022), Sillamäe Museum (2023), and the EKA gallery
            of Tallinn (2023).
          </p>
          <p>
            The artworks were based on ethnographic research with three local
            artists—Anna Škodenko, Darja Popolitova and Viktor Gurov,
            investigating the material culture on the border between Russia and
            Estonia, characterized by secrecy and mistrust. As we learnt after
            visiting 37 basements in this region, shadow spaces play an
            important role to testing multiple sides of the self.
