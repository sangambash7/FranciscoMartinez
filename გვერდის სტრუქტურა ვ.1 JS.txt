          The Future of Hiding. Secrecy, Energy Infrastructure and the
          Recolonization of Estonia’s Siberia. Cornell University Press, 2025.
        </h2>
        <p>
          The Future of Hiding analyzes the territorial dimensions of secrecy,
          its contribution to social order, and how concealment takes place in
          relation to energy infrastructure. The ethnography shows how shadow
          spaces connect the private and the social by furnishing a space for
          retreat, thus allowing opacity and diversity against the central gaze.
          The research highlights the way in which basements, garages, bunkers,
          and summer cottages operate as a surplus of living at the border with
          Russia, allowing local residents to redesign the very terms of their
          social being.

          Field research in this liminal region provides a dearth of information
          about political alterity, ecological memory, recolonization, and what
          does not disappear properly. Therefore, this book expands the space
          for locating culture, politics, and the reproduction and destruction
          of infrastructure, showing, in turn, alternative forms of sociality
          and various strategies, such as refusal and concealment, used by
          individuals to navigate sociopolitical change and the consequences of
          a century of extractive activities.

          The Future of Hiding makes a significant contribution to our
          understanding of people, places, and things that are perceived as out
          of place and time, often relegated to a corner as disruptions to the
          social order. Drawing on ethnographic research in eastern Estonia, a
          region considered residual within the country’s context, Martínez
          demonstrates that the colonial character of extractivism is not that
          far past. These elements of infrastructural harm stem from present
          forms of domination that dictate modes of affiliation with the
          nation-state and foster a pervasive sense of precarity and
          uncertainty. Alina Jašina-Schäfer, University of Mainz

          This original book examines how infrastructures are lived in the
          borderlands between Russia and the European Union. The ethnography
          offers a thought-provoking examination of the gradual decomposition of
          a long-disappeared polity—the Soviet Union. Drawing on fieldwork in
          Estonia—an area often overlooked, Martínez transcends disciplinary
          boundaries to study topics ranging from post-socialism and colonialism
          to place-making, social organization, and identity formation. His work
          is not only meticulously researched but also deeply engaging. Giorgi
